# Installation

**[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)**

```lua
{ "olrtg/nvim-i18n", dependencies = "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim", config = true },
```

# Motivation

I often work with translations files and since I've migrated to neovim (early 2022) the only missing piece to stay forever in neovim is a i18n plugin. Visual Studio Code has one called [i18n-ally](https://github.com/lokalise/i18n-ally) which it's f\*cking great and I sometimes just hate opening vscode to use that plugin.

This is my attempt of building something like that but for neovim. I'm fairly new when it comes to plugin development (this is my second plugin) but since I don't see anyone building something like this I've decided to take matters into my own hands.

Hope you enjoy it!
